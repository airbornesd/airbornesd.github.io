focus on fundamentals that underpin all data engineering systems, including algorithms, data structures, operating systems, networking, memory layout, concurrency, and file systems.

## key concepts

- complexity, time-space tradeoff, big-o
- memory layout: stack vs heap
- process vs thread concurrency
- tcp/http lifecycle
- event loop vs blocking i/o

## explanation practice

- tcp 3-way handshake
- hash map internals
- memory layout diagram
- event loop diagram

# projects

## 1. python job scheduler

- simulate airflow dag execution using multiprocessing

## 2. custom tcp chat system

- socket programming, concurrency, message delivery

## 3. heap-based ranking system

- trending topics or priority queue simulation

## 4. in-memory key-value store

- hashmap + persistence simulation
