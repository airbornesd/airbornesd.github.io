focus on architecture documentation, storytelling for system design, reproducibility, data contracts, and whiteboard explanation practice.

## key concepts

- architecture diagrams (excalidraw, mermaid)
- project storytelling pattern: what → how → why → tradeoffs
- data contracts and schema registry
- reproducible notebooks (jupyter, papermill)
- live whiteboard practice for interviews
- explanation of pipelines to non-technical and technical audiences

## explanation practice

- draw end-to-end architecture on digital pad
- flow diagrams for pipelines
- whiteboard explanation of ETL, streaming, or web3 pipelines

## projects

### 1. project documentation repo

- markdown + mermaid diagrams for each pipeline/project

### 2. data contract generator

- schema registry integration for multiple pipelines

### 3. jupyter pipeline demo

- automate data prep + ETL + feature extraction for ML

### 4. whiteboard interview exercises

- recreate pipeline diagrams and explain in 5 mins
- record self explanation for refinement
