### full mlops-ready feature pipeline

#### what it is

a bridge between data engineering and machine learning operations that automates the creation, storage, and serving of machine learning features through batch and streaming modes.

#### what you’ll build

- feature generation logic based on user activity, transactions, or temporal patterns
- pipelines for batch (historical) and streaming (real-time) feature computation
- offline store (parquet files on s3) and online store (redis) for feature storage
- feature serving api using fastapi for real-time inference requests
- feature versioning and metadata tracking with mlflow integration
- simulation of ml model training consuming generated features

#### approach

- define feature definitions in feast or tecton
- register offline and online stores with consistent schema
- compute time-windowed and cumulative features using spark or pandas udfs
- expose low-latency api endpoints to deliver features to downstream ml systems
- track feature lineage, freshness, and validation through mlflow or custom metadata stores

#### tech stack

- feature store: feast or tecton
- compute: spark or pandas
- online store: redis
- versioning and tracking: mlflow
- api: fastapi

#### learning outcomes

- understand mlops architecture linking data pipelines to model deployment
- build reproducible, version-controlled feature sets
- learn hybrid batch-streaming data unification for consistent ml training and inference
- design low-latency serving systems for production-grade ml use cases
- develop collaboration workflows between data engineers and data scientists

### why these projects are valuable

- they replicate real production systems and include failure handling, scalability, and monitoring principles.
- they expose you to a wide range of tools and frameworks used in industry.
- they produce complete, demonstrable artifacts—pipelines, documentation, and dashboards—for portfolio presentation.
- they enable a gradual learning progression from batch to streaming to mlops workflows.
- they prepare you for technical discussions on trade-offs like batch vs streaming, lakehouse vs warehouse, or kafka vs kinesis.
