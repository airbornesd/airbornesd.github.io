### real-time streaming pipeline

#### what it is

a real-time event-driven data processing system capable of consuming continuous data streams, transforming them, and producing analytics with sub-second latency. this mirrors production-grade architectures used in iot, trading, or telemetry analytics.

#### what youâ€™ll build

- event simulation using python for iot or market data streams
- kafka topics producing and consuming real-time events
- stream processing with faust or spark structured streaming implementing window-based aggregation
- time-series database (postgresql + timescaledb) for storing processed metrics
- grafana visualization showing live throughput, errors, and lag
- alerting for pipeline degradation or schema mismatches

#### approach

- define kafka topic schemas using avro or protobuf for serialization safety
- design a producer-consumer pattern ensuring at-least-once or exactly-once delivery semantics
- perform stateful transformations such as moving averages or anomaly detection
- expose lag, processing rate, and error metrics to prometheus for real-time visibility

#### tech stack

- messaging: kafka or redpanda
- processing: python (faust, kafka-python) or spark structured streaming
- storage: timescaledb
- monitoring: prometheus and grafana

#### learning outcomes

- master real-time architecture and event-driven programming concepts
- understand windowing, watermarking, and message retention strategies
- learn to design fault-tolerant streaming consumers
- implement observability and anomaly alerting for live data streams
- practice schema evolution management for continuously changing inputs
