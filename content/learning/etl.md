### ðŸ”¹ definition

etl (extract, transform, load) is a **data integration process** that collects, cleans, and organizes data from multiple sources into a **single, consistent dataset** â€” typically for a **data warehouse, data lake, or analytical system**.

---

## ðŸ”¸ step 1: extract

raw data is **copied or exported** from source systems into a **staging area**.

**typical data sources:**

- sql / nosql servers
- crm or erp systems
- json / xml files
- flat-file databases (csv, txt)
- emails or logs
- web pages or apis

---

## ðŸ”¸ step 2: transform

this step **cleans and restructures** the extracted data.

**common operations:**

- filter
- clean
- aggregate
- de-duplicate
- validate
- authenticate
- calculate metrics
- apply audits
- encrypt for security and compliance
- reformat or join tables to match schema

---

## ðŸ”¸ step 3: load

the **final transformed dataset** is moved from the staging area into a **target warehouse or analytical system**.

---

## âœ… benefits

- best suited for **smaller data volumes**
- preferred when **data needs to be transformed before loading**
- good for **batch-oriented** updates
