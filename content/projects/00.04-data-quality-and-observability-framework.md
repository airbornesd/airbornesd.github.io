### data quality and observability framework

#### what it is

a monitoring and validation layer designed to measure data reliability, lineage, and pipeline health across the entire lifecycle of ingestion, transformation, and consumption.

#### what youâ€™ll build

- custom validation rules testing completeness, accuracy, uniqueness, and referential integrity
- integration of great expectations or soda into existing airflow dags
- lineage tracking using amundsen or datahub metadata systems
- observability dashboard highlighting data anomalies, sla breaches, and failed checks
- alerting workflows delivering slack or email notifications

#### approach

- define data contracts specifying expected schema and thresholds for validation
- embed quality checks as separate airflow tasks post-transformation
- collect metadata about datasets, schema versions, and validation results
- implement an observability layer to visualize test outcomes and system latency

#### tech stack

- validation: great expectations or soda core
- orchestration: airflow with custom sensors
- metadata: amundsen or datahub (optional)
- alerting: slack/email integration

#### learning outcomes

- gain experience in implementing end-to-end data observability
- understand how to embed validation and quality enforcement directly within pipelines
- track data lineage and schema drift for compliance and debugging
- build proactive alerting systems reducing operational downtime
- apply principles of reliability engineering to data ecosystems
