### self-healing data pipeline with automated rollback and data quality enforcement

#### what it is

a pipeline that continuously monitors data quality, detects anomalies, and automatically reverts to stable versions upon detecting schema or data drift, emulating resilient production-grade systems.

#### what youâ€™ll build

- dbt models with strict validation rules (e.g., null percentage thresholds, uniqueness constraints)
- airflow dags incorporating sensors that trigger rollback actions
- git integration enabling automatic reversion of dbt models to last known good commit
- alerting and root-cause summaries via slack notifications

#### approach

- create monitoring logic that tracks schema drift using metadata comparisons
- use gitpython to perform model version rollbacks automatically
- store validation results and metadata snapshots for auditing
- simulate data drift and validate rollback reliability through test scenarios

#### tech stack

- transformation: dbt
- data quality: soda
- orchestration: airflow with custom operators
- version control: gitpython
- alerting: slack webhooks

#### learning outcomes

- design self-correcting, resilient data systems
- understand metadata tracking and rollback automation principles
- implement operational data contracts to ensure schema and business rule consistency
- demonstrate production reliability engineering concepts within data workflows
