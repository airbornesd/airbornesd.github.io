### real-time slippage and latency monitor for trading systems

#### what it is

a high-performance data pipeline measuring trading slippage (difference between expected and executed price) and latency (order to fill time) in simulated environments to evaluate system efficiency.

#### what you’ll build

- simulated order streams from market maker and taker agents (python)
- kafka event stream representing order books and trades
- flink (or spark) job computing slippage and latency metrics in real time
- grafana dashboard visualizing latency distribution and slippage patterns

#### approach

- reconstruct order books from live kafka events
- calculate slippage as (fill_price - mid_price_at_order_time) / mid_price_at_order_time
- track latency by comparing timestamps between order submission and execution
- define anomaly thresholds and trigger alerts (e.g., slippage > 2σ or latency > 100ms)
- optionally inject artificial network delays using linux traffic control (tc) to simulate production latency

#### tech stack

- data source: simulated exchange or binance websocket mock
- streaming: kafka + flink (event-time processing)
- storage: apache iceberg + redis (real-time cache)
- visualization: grafana + prometheus
- infrastructure: docker compose

#### learning outcomes

- understand financial microstructure concepts (spread, fill rate, execution efficiency)
- learn to design ultra-low-latency data observability pipelines
- develop expertise in event-time processing using flink
- create domain-specific data engineering experience applicable to quant and hft systems
