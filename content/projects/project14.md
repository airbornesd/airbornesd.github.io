#### project 14: the "system design" documentation

scenario: you are handing over the project to a new engineer.
the mission: create a high-level architecture diagram and a "runbook."

- tech: draw.io, markdown.
- challenge: communication is the hardest engineering skill.
- dev to prod:
  1. create a diagram linking kafka, spark, s3, redshift, and airflow.
  2. write a `readme.md` explaining how to recover if the kafka broker dies.
  3. prod requirement: this is your interview "show and tell" artifact.
