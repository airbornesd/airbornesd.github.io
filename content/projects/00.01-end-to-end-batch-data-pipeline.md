### end-to-end batch data pipeline

#### what it is

a foundational batch data pipeline that ingests structured or semi-structured data, transforms it through orchestrated workflows, and makes it available for analytics or downstream systems. this type of system models how enterprise-grade etl/elt data flows operate for reporting and decision-making.

#### what youâ€™ll build

- ingestion of csv or json data from public apis such as openweather or nyc taxi datasets
- local or s3-based staging layer for raw data persistence
- airflow dag scheduling daily ingestion jobs
- dbt transformations converting raw data into analytics-ready tables (star schema modeling)
- loading cleaned data into a relational data warehouse (postgresql or snowflake)
- lightweight rest api (flask or fastapi) for exposing aggregated analytical metrics

#### approach

- implement source ingestion in python using pandas or pyspark for large datasets
- define a modular airflow dag separating extraction, transformation, and load phases
- apply dbt tests for data quality validation (uniqueness, null checks, referential integrity)
- store intermediate artifacts in minio or local staging folders for auditability
- automate orchestration and logging through airflow ui and dag-level monitoring

#### tech stack

- language: python (pandas, pyspark)
- orchestration: apache airflow
- transformation: dbt
- storage: postgresql or snowflake
- infrastructure: docker or local environment

#### learning outcomes

- understand the fundamentals of batch-oriented etl/elt systems
- learn orchestration of multi-stage data workflows
- gain experience with analytical modeling and schema design
- implement data validation and pipeline reliability techniques
- build end-to-end observability through logs and test results
