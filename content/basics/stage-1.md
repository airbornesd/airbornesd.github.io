## programming foundations (logic clarity)

goal: think clearly in steps.

- [x] if-else mastery (edge cases)
- [x] loops (for, while, nested loops)
- [x] functions (pure functions vs stateful)
- [x] basic math problems (factorial, prime, fibonacci, digit sum)
- [ ] string manipulation (reverse, palindrome, frequency count)

focus: clarity > cleverness.
