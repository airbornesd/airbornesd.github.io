## dsa (only what data engineers actually use)

goal: structured thinking.

- [ ] arrays / lists (traversal, slicing)
- [ ] strings (parsing heavy)
- [ ] hashmaps / dictionaries (very important)
- [ ] sets (uniqueness logic)
- [ ] stack (balanced brackets)
- [ ] queue (basic simulation)
- [ ] binary search (understand idea, not obsession)

core idea: lookup efficiency and grouping.
