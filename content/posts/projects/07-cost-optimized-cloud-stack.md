### cost-optimized cloud data stack with terraform and auto-scaling

#### what it is

a cost-efficient cloud-based data stack focusing on elasticity, fault-tolerance, and minimal resource waste using infrastructure-as-code and spot instances.

#### what youâ€™ll build

- terraform modules provisioning s3/gcs, emr/dataproc, and kafka (msk/pubsub)
- auto-scaling spark clusters leveraging spot or preemptible instances
- central cost monitoring dashboard using aws cost explorer api or opencost
- optional airflow orchestration for pipeline triggering

#### approach

- define reusable terraform modules for data infrastructure
- integrate lifecycle policies to reduce idle resource costs
- simulate load-based scaling policies under various throughput levels
- benchmark cloud cost vs performance tradeoffs

#### tech stack

- infrastructure: terraform
- compute: aws emr or gcp dataproc
- storage: s3 or gcs
- orchestration: airflow (optional)
- monitoring: opencost or cost explorer api

#### learning outcomes

- connect data engineering with financial optimization (finops)
- master infrastructure-as-code deployment for multi-service systems
- understand auto-scaling mechanics for distributed data platforms
- demonstrate cloud efficiency and ownership mindset
