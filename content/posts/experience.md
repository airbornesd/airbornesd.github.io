- it uses smart tools for analytics, alerts, and integrations to make finance easier and more secure.

**key responsibilities and projects**

- as the founding data engineer, i was responsible for building the entire data system from nothing.
- this included collecting data, processing it, storing it, and making it useful for the business.

**project 1: building the aws data platform from scratch**

- **what i did**:

  - i set up the system to collect events (like user actions or transactions) from sources like dynamodb (a fast database) and sftp (a secure file transfer).
  - i used tools like kinesis, firehose, and kafka to bring in the data quickly.
  - every day, the system handles over 1 million events.

- **technical details**:

  - i processed this data using spark on glue jobs.
  - this allowed for quick transformations, like analyzing trading sessions, checking for fraud, and executing trades, all with very low delay (less than 150 milliseconds).
  - this made dashboards update almost instantly.

- **impact**:

  - this enabled real-time analytics for trades and helped detect fraud early, which is crucial in fintech to prevent losses.

- **challenges**:

  - starting from zero meant deciding on the best tools without any existing setup.
  - i had to ensure it could scale as the user base grew to 50,000 daily active users (dau).

- **what i learned**:
  - i gained experience in designing systems that handle high volumes of data in real time.
  - it taught me the importance of low-latency processing in financial apps where seconds matter.

**project 2: automating etl pipelines**

- **what i did**:

  - i used airflow and glue to automate the data workflows.
  - this included checks for data quality, monitoring for issues, automatic retries if something failed, and reconciliation (matching data from different sources).

- **technical details**:

  - these automations reduced support tickets by 65%, meaning fewer manual fixes were needed.

- **impact**:

  - it improved features like subscriptions (recurring payments) and chat-and-pay (ai-based payment tools), making the platform more user-friendly and boosting engagement.

- **challenges**:

  - integrating with gamification features (like daily tasks to encourage users) required careful planning to keep data flowing smoothly.

- **what i learned**:
  - automation is key to efficiency.
  - i learned how to build reliable pipelines that run without constant oversight, saving time for the team.

**project 3: storage and serving layer design**

- **what i did**:

  - i organized data storage in s3 buckets with zones for raw, processed, and curated data.
  - for queries, i used redshift and athena.
  - i also created tableau dashboards for investors to see key metrics.

- **technical details**:

  - this supported monitoring kpis like profit/loss, delinquent accounts (late payments), bankruptcy risks, and dormant accounts (inactive users).

- **impact**:

  - these dashboards helped during investor meetings by showing clear financial health.

- **challenges**:

  - ensuring data was secure and compliant with fintech regulations.

- **what i learned**:
  - proper data organization makes analysis faster and more accurate.
  - i understood how zoning data helps in managing large datasets without confusion.

**project 4: ci/cd tooling development**

- **what i did**:

  - i built custom tools in python for continuous integration and deployment (ci/cd) of the data pipelines.

- **technical details**:

  - this reduced deployment time by 40%, meaning updates could go live faster.

- **impact**:

  - it aligned the technical work with business goals, like revenue growth, and helped in seed funding by proving the system's scalability.

- **challenges**:

  - coordinating with the ceo and other teams to prioritize features.

- **what i learned**:
  - leadership in decision-making and how technical choices directly affect business outcomes, like funding rounds.

**overall lessons from blazpay ai**

- working here strengthened my skills in ai-integrated fintech.
- i learned to balance speed and reliability in data systems, especially for real-time features.
- being the first engineer built my ownership mindset and taught me cross-team collaboration.
